i got my name from someone i looked up to years ago. i just replaced one letter, and ive stuck with it

i'm really inconsistent with everything. i don't like working on projects with a schedule, which leads to me getting nothing done because i rarely feel motivated. i tend to have random bursts of activity and productivity after long stretches of not working on anything. i know i need to fix this, but fixing things is hard.
